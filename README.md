# Techathlon
Repo of code written for the smart farming platform developed as part of Techathlon '18

This project won the second price in the hackathon.

This is just the part of the code that runs on a Raspberry Pi. 
There is another script which runs on a collection of NodeMCUs which form a mesh network. 
This code however is written by my teammate and isn't available in this repo
